# Tape_Conversion
Basic conversion for MGJ1 & NXJ2 tape reels.

Allows you to input the rows left on the reel (manually count them) and the code will tell you how many slots
are left on the reel. It will then convert to metres remaining on reel.

Can change the variables in the first few rows of code for different reel sizes; equation & conversion should work either way.
