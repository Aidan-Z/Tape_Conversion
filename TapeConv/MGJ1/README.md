# Tape_Conversion
Basic conversion for MGJ1 tape reel.

Allows you to input the rows left on the reel (manually count them) and the code will tell you how many slots
are left on the reel. This specific file is for the MGJ1 reel therefore it also provides the user with the amount
of slots required to complete a new 7" reel.

Can change the variables in the first few rows of code for different reel sizes,
equation & conversion should work either way.
